= AsciiDoc Syntax Highlighting
// There are multiple level 0 sections, so use book instead of article.
:doctype: book
// For nice admonition and callout icons.
:icons: font
:toc: left

Testing the syntax highlighting support in KDE Frameworks.

The first of the following sections lists the things that are known not to work.
Further sections are intended for testing the supported features of AsciiDoc.


= Known Not to Work

There are a couple of things that are known not to work.


== Block

* Highlighting of attributes inside a block title.

* Highlighting of formatted text inside a block title other than ...
** #marked#
** `monospaced`

* Code folding for contiguous blocks.
+
This has an advantage too, though.
It enables the user to decide on having code folding or not.
For short blocks without empty lines where no code folding is desired, use contiguous blocks.
For longer blocks which should support code folding, use delimited blocks.

* https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#discrete-headings[Discrete headings]  inside block.
+
-----
****
Some text.

[discrete]
=== Discrete Heading

Some more text.
****
-----
+
Syntax highlighting does not recognize discrete headings inside a block.
If a normal section title is marked as being discrete, highlighting works.


== Custom Styles

* Highlighting of formatted text within the phrase to be styled.
+
  Some [big]#big and *strong*# text.

* Highlighting of styles with a phrase that spans multiple lines.
+
----
[big]#this
is
not
highlighted#
----


== Formatted/Quoted Text

* Highlighting of formatted/quoted text (e.g. monospaced) that spans multiple lines.

* Highlighting combinations besides those of emphasized, strong and monospaced.
** Attributes inside other formatting.
+
  `{attribute-id} inside monospaced`

** Passthrough inside other formatting.
+
  `+passthrough+ inside monospaced`

** Marked text inside other formatting.
+
  `#marked# inside monospaced`

** Subscript inside other formatting.
+
  `~sub~script inside monospaced`

** Superscript inside other formatting.
+
  `^super^script inside monospaced`

And even more complex combinations.


== List

* Inside a list, indented lines without leading asterisks or hyphen start highlighting for a verbatim paragraph.
Asciidoctor renders this as normal text.


== Macro

* Highlighting of macros with a text argument that spans multiple lines.
+
----
xref:id[this works just fine]

xref:id[
highlighting a macro with
a text that spans multiples
does not work
]
----


== Quote, Verse

* Highlighting for single quote symbol `"`.
+
Highlighting for air quotes `""` is supported.

* Highlighting for Markdown style quotes.


== Replacement

Highlighting for replacements is limited to those listed in the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#replacements[Asciidoctor Manual] and numerical character references.

Highlighting for other https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references[HTML/XML character references] is not supported.

.Examples of supported references
* `+(C)+` resulting in (C)
* `+=>+` resulting in =>
* `+&#188;+` resulting in &#188;

.Examples of references that are not supported
* `+&frac14;+` resulting in &frac14;
* `+&phi;+` resulting in &phi;


== Section

* Setext style for section titles.
+
Only Atx style is supported.
+
NOTE: Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/[recommended practices] states _not_ to use Setext style for section titles.

* Highlighting of formatted/quoted text inside section title other than ...
** #marked#
** `monospaced`


== Table

* Highlighting of tables with custom separator.
** The custom separator will _not_ be highlighted.
** All `|` inside the table _will be falsly_ highlighted.

* Highlighting of delimiter-separated tables.
** Table delimiters in shorthand notation and the value separator will _not_ be highlighted.
** All `|` inside the table _will be falsly_ highlighted.

* Applying styles on table contents.
+
When defining a table, individual columns or cells can be defined to be highlighted *strong* etc..
Corresponding highlighting of these cells does not work.



= Admonition

== Simple Format

NOTE: A simple note.

Some text.
NOTE: This is not a separate note as it is part of the paragraph started with the line above.

NOTE:This is not a note as there is no space after the `:`.

  NOTE: This is not a note as it is indented.

NOTE : This is not a note as there are spaces between `NOTE` and `:`.

NOTE:
This is not a note as it is not using block format and the text is not starting on the same line as the label.

NOTE: This is a lengthy note in simple format.
Second line.
One more line.
And another one.
This is the last line.

This line is not part of the simple note anymore.

CAUTION: This is a CAUTION.

IMPORTANT: This is IMPORTANT.

TIP: This is a TIP. +
This second line is rendered as a line on its own because of the trailing `+` in the first line.

WARNING: This is a WARNING.


== Block Format

.Contiguous
[NOTE]
[[contiguous-note-id]]
This is a contiguous *note* block.
Second line.
And one more line.
// comment inside block
This is the final line.

This line is not part of the contiguous note block anymore.

.Delimited
[NOTE]
[[delimited-note-id]]
====
This is a *note* in block format.
As a block, the note may have a title
// comment inside block

In block format, multiple lines, paragraphs etc. are possible.
====

There is no delimited admonition block without block name.
Using `====` delimiter without a block name results in an example block.

.Using open block
[NOTE]
--
Inside the open block note.
--


= [[main-1]]An[[main-2]]chor[[main-3]] and Cross Reference

== [[section-1]][[section-2]] An[[section-3]][[section-4]]chor[[section-5]]

[[isolated-anchor]]
Isolated anchor.

[[isolated-anchor-with-label,Isolated Anchor With Label]]
Isolated anchor with label.

This line has an [[inline-anchor, Inline Anchor]]anchor placed inside the text.

[#isolated-shorthand]
Isolated anchor using shorthand definition.

[#isolated-shorthand, Isolated Shorthand Anchor]
Isolated anchor with label using shorthand definition.

This line has an   [    #inline-shorthand    ]#anchor placed inside the text#  #.

.Inside [[block-anchor]]block title
Works too.

.Macro form
There is also a maanchor:anchor-id[Macro Anchor]cro form for anchor definition.

NOTE: There is no space needed before the `anchor` macro name.
Also not after the closing `]`.


=== Not an anchor

[[ not-an-anchor]]
because of the space after the opening brackets.

[[not-an-anchor ]]
because of the space before the closing brackets.

 [[not-an-anchor]] because of line starting with spaces.

 [#not-an-anchor]#because# of line starting with spaces.

[#not-an-anchor] because of trailing text.

Not an anchor because of leading text [#not-an-anchor]

Also[#not-an-anchor]#some text# because of missing space before `[`.

Also [#not-an-anchor] #some text# because of space after `]`.

Also [#not-an-anchor]# some text# because of space after the leading `#`.

Also [#not-an-anchor]because of missing referred text (e.g. `#some text#`).


=== Escaped

This is an escaped \[[anchor-id, some #anchor# label]] anchor.

This is just some \normal text.

Some\[[anchor-id]]anchor.

\[[anchor-id]]

////
FIXME: highlighting differs
Asciidoctor seems to just pass through the anchor when escaping it.
This behaviour is rather unexpected, as in other cases the escaped contents is subject to further highlighting.

We currently only consume the opening bracket.
////
This is an escaped \[#shorthand-id]#anchor in shorthand form#.

Some \[#shorthand-id].

\[#shorthand-id]

\[#shorthand-id]#


== Cross References

<<main-1>>

<<main-2>>

<<main-3>>

<<section-1>>

This is a reference to <<section-2>>.

<<section-3>> some text >> some more text

some << text <<<section-4>>>

<<section-5>>

<<isolated-anchor>>

<<isolated-anchor-with-label>>

<<inline-anchor>>

<<isolated-shorthand>>

<<inline-shorthand>>.

<<block-anchor>>


=== Escaped

This is not a reference \<<section-1>>.


= Attribute

== No Value

:some-attribute:
This line should not be highlighted.

  :not-an-attribute: as the line is indented.


== Single Line Value

Attributes with values that are rendered as a single line, even if their definition spans multiple lines.

.Single line definition
:single-line: only one line
This line is not part of the attribute value anymore.

##before##{single-line}##after##

:attr-in-attr-value: in multi line definition

.Multi line definition
:single-line-continued: First line {attr-in-attr-value}. \
Second line. \
Another line.
This line is not part of the attribute value anymore.

##before##{single-line-continued}##after##

IMPORTANT: At least one space is needed before the continuation `\`.

.Line continuation is only highlighted when inside an attribute definition
some \
text


== Multi Line Value

Attributes with values including hard line breaks.

IMPORTANT: At least one space is needed before the continuation `+` and between the `+` and the `\`.

:multi-line: First line. + \
Second line.   +    \
Third line.
This line is not part of the attribute value anymore.

##before##{multi-line}##after##


== Inline Definition

Inline attribute definitions {set:inline-attribute:just fine} works {inline-attribute}.

.Surplus `:` is part of the value
{set:attr::some value}
{attr}

{set:attr}
{attr}

.Not an inline definition as leading `set:` is missing
{single-line:some value}


== Unsetting

:!_custom_2-:
:_custom_2-!:

.Adding a value when unsetting doesn't make sense, but doesn't hurt either
:some-attribute: some value
Attribute is set to `{some-attribute}`.

:!some-attribute: some value
{some-attribute} is not set anymore.


== Not an Attribute

:not-an-attribute:as there is no space after the terminating column of the identifier

  :not-an-attribute: as it is indented


== Combination with Other Highlighting

****
:inside-a-block: inside a block
Using an attribute {inside-a-block} works too.
****

:inside-formatting: inside formatting
An attribute used `{inside-formatting}` is not highlighting as attribute.


== Escaped

\:attr-1: escaped attribute definition + \
second line of escaped attribute definition

\:!attr-1: escaped unset attribute

\:-attr-1: this is not highlighted as escaped attribute definition as it has an invalid attribute id.

This \:attr-1: is not highlighted as escaped attribute definition as it is not used at line start.

:attr-1: some attribute
This is not rendered as \{attr-1}.

This is not an inline attribute definition \{set:attr-2:some other attribute}. +
{attr-2} is not set.

****
:inside-a-block: inside a block
Escaping an attribute \{inside-a-block} works too.
****


= Bibliography

== Using References

The first reference has no label, so its id <<ref-1>> is rendered.

The second reference has number <<r2>> as label.

The third reference has <<r3>> as label.

A reference definition inside the text instead of the bibliography section yields some strange result: [[[ref-o,outside bibliography]]]].
Not sure what to do with this.

This is trying to use the escaped reference <<r4>>.

This is trying to use reference <<r6>>.


[bibliography]
== References

- [[[ref-1]]] This is reference 1.
- [[[r2,2]]]This is reference 2.
- [[[r3,Some Text]]]
This is reference 3.
- [\[[r4, escaped]]] This is #escaped#.
- [[[r5,5]]] This is reference 5.
* [[[r6,strange]]] Using an asterisk yields a strange result.


= Block

[abstract]
.Abstract - contiguous block
This document is used for testing syntax highlighting regarding various types of blocks.
E.g. this contiguous abstract block. +
Using block form for the abstract seems to be rendered differently than the section form (see `section.adoc`).

[abstract]
.Abstract - delimited open block
--
Using the delimited block form ...

enables having empty lines in the abstract.
--


== General

NOTE: Starting and ending delimiter must be balanced, meaning they must have the same length.

....
Inside the block.
....

[literal]
.Block title `after` block meta data
....
Inside the block.
....

// Add `:icons: font` for nice callout icons.

Callouts are usually used with listing/source blocks, but Asciidoctor renders them also without a listing block.

<1>   This is a callout.
<.> This is a callout too.

 <2> This is not rendered as a callout as it is indented.

The line below is not rendered as a callout as it has no text in the same line.

<3>

The line below is not rendered as callout as it is part of this paragraph.

= Comment

TIP: Comment highlighting supports the standard https://cgit.kde.org/syntax-highlighting.git/tree/data/syntax/alert.xml[KDE alerts] (TODO, FIXME, ...) in both single-line and multi-line comments.


== Single Line

Single-line comments start with exactly `//`.
If there are any characters - including spaces - before the `//`, the line will be rendered.
If there are more than two consecutive `/`, the line will be rendered.

This line // will be rendered completely.

  // This line will be rendered as verbatim text as it is indented.

/// This line will be rendered as it starts with 3 `/`.

// This line will be invisible.

//This line will be invisible.

= Counter

== Use and Render

.Start with 1 and render value
New value for `c1` is {counter:c1}.

.Increment and render
And now it is {counter:c1}.

.Render the current value without changing it
Current value is {c1}.


== Use Without Rendering

.Define the new counter
No new value to be {counter2:c2}seen.

.Let's see the current value
Current value is {c2}.

.Increment
No incremented value to be {counter2:c2}seen.

.Let's see the current value
Current value is {c2}.


== Using a Start Value

.Start with 3 and render value
New value for `c3` is {counter:c3:99}.

.Increment and render
And now it is {counter:c3}.

.Works with characters too
New value for `c4` is {counter:c4:X}

.Increment character counter and render
And now it is {counter:c4}.


== About using Spaces

CAUTION: If you leave spaces after the `:` or before the closing `}`, Asciidoctor will make them part of the counter attribute name. +
So it's probably wise to avoid spaces here.

.Define a counter
New value is {counter:c5}.

.This is actually a new counter
New value is {counter: c5}.

.But you can't access that attribute
Can't just show the current value { c5}

.Only if we increment it
Incremented value is {counter: c5}.

.This is again a new counter
New value is {counter:  c5}.

.This is also a new counter
New value is {counter:c5 }.

CAUTION: Similar problems occur when using spaces around starting values. +
*Just don't use spaces*.

.New counter with start value
New value is {counter:c6: 9 }

.But when trying to increment
Incremented value is {counter:c6}



= Text Formatting

TIP: Asciidoctor uses also the term _quoted text_.

== Custom Styles

[big]#big text#

Some [.big]#big text#.

Some [big]#big and *strong* text#.

Some text with [foo]#custom style#.

[foo bar]#foo bar text#

before![big]#big text#

[big]#big text#!after

[big]##*text*##

////
FIXME Highlighting differs.
The phrase is rendered as marked.
The trailing hash is therefore not visible.
////
[big]###text###

[fo[o]#some text#


[underline]_emphasized and underlined_

[underline]__emphasized and underlined_


[underline]`monospaced and underlined`

[underline]``monospaced and underlined``


[underline]*strong and underlined*

[underline]**strong and underlined**


=== Not rendered as custom style

[fo]o]#not a custom style# because of surplus `]`.

[big]not a phrase because of missing phrase markers.

[big]# # because only spaces used as phrase.

[big]# the phrase# because of leading space in phrase.

[big]#the phrase # because of trailing space in phrase.

Before[foo]#the phrase# because of missing non-word character before clause.

Before [foo]#the phrase#after because of missing non-word character after clause.


=== Escaped

This is not \[underline]#underlined text#.


== Emphasized

=== Rendered formatted

This line contains a _sequence_ of _multiple emphasized_ words.

This line contains a single _emphasized_ word.

This line contains a single __emphasized_ word.

This line contains a single _emphasized__ word.

The text within the brackets should be (_emphasized_), but the brackets themselves not.

(_emphasized_  [_emphasized_  {_emphasized_  |_emphasized_  ._emphasized_  ,_emphasized_  !_emphasized_  ?_emphasized_  _emphasized_?

_emphasized_) _emphasized_] _emphasized_} _emphasized_| _emphasized_. _emphasized_; _emphasized_,

_emphasized_( _emphasized_( _emphasized_[ _emphasized_{

_emphasized_)

_emphasized_

__aa__bb

aa__bb__

aa__bb _cc__dd

aa__bb cc___dd

aa__ bb __cc


=== Rendered as-is

This line does not contain _some emphasized _ text as there is a surplus space.

This line does not contain_some emphasized_ text as there is a space missing.

This line does not contain _some emphasized_text as there is a space missing.

foo ;_emphasized_ :_emphasized_ }_emphasized_

;_emphasized_
:_emphasized_
}_emphasized_

// FIXME Highlighting differs.
In this line, there is some ___very emphasized___ text.
Asciidoctor renders it as normal text, just ignoring all the underscores.
That is a bit strange.


=== Escaped

Not \_emphasized_ as it is escaped.

Still \__emphasized__ as only the outermost level is escaped.


== Marked

=== Rendered formatted

Some # marked # text.

Works #also for multiple words#.

Some ##marked# text.

Some #marked## text.
