# RETRO Test File

This is an example of the literate format
RETRO uses, which lets us program in a literate style.

```
:test ;
```

That was a test block. It defines a test.

~~~
:word (note)
	#1 'mald_%n s:format s:put
	.1.0 drop
;

:hm (idk)
~~~

That's the start of a word.

These code fences can be placed anywhere.
~~~
	&A $A `a \a |a @a !a
;
~~~

Running that gibberish code is not safe for your system, probably.
You wouldn't wanna do it.
