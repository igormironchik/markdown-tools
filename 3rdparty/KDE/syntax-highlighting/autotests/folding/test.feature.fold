Feature: Let’s test Cucumber feature syntax highlighting
  These are just example features to see that syntax highlighting works.

  These features are copied from Cucumber’s documentation, and they are
  licensed under MIT.

  # Comments are not considered to be part of a feature.
  Rule: Users are notified about overdue tasks on first use of the day
    Background:
      Given I have overdue tasks

    Example: First use of the day
      <beginfold id='1'>"""</beginfold id='1'>
      Docstrings can also be used.
      <endfold id='1'>"""</endfold id='1'>
      Given I last used the app yesterday
      When I use the app
      Then I am notified about overdue tasks

    Example: Already used today
      Given I last used the app earlier today
      When I use the app
      Then I am not notified about overdue tasks

Feature: Multiple site support
  Only blog owners can post to a blog, except administrators,
  who can post to all blogs.

  Background:
    Given a global administrator named "Greg"
    And a blog named "Greg's anti-tax rants"
    * a customer named "Dr. Bill"
    And a blog named "Expensive Therapy" owned by "Dr. Bill"

  @tagged_scenario
  Scenario: Dr. Bill posts to his own blog
    Given I am logged in as Dr. Bill
    When I try to post to "Expensive Therapy"
    Then I should see "Your article was published."

  Scenario: Dr. Bill tries to post to somebody else's blog, and fails
    Given the following users exist:
      | name   | email              | twitter         |
      | Aslak  | aslak@cucumber.io  | @aslak_hellesoy |
      | Julien | julien@cucumber.io | @jbpros         |
      | Matt   | matt@cucumber.io   | @mattwynne      |
    When I try to post to "Greg's anti-tax rants"
    Then I should see "Hey! That's not your blog!"

Feature: There can also be Scenario Outline

  Scenario Outline: eating
    Given there are <start> cucumbers
    When I eat <eat> cucumbers
    Then I should have <left> cucumbers

    Examples:
      | start | eat | left |
      |    12 |   5 |    7 |
      |    20 |   5 |   15 |
