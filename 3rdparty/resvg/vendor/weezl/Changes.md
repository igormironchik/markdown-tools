## Version 0.1.8

- Fixed incorrect state after `Decoder::reset`
- Added `Debug` to result types

## Version 0.1.7

- Implicit reset is now supported for decoding.

## Version 0.1.6

- Fixed an integer overflow and panic that could occur during decoding.
  Decoding performance may degrade after long sequences without a reset code.

## Version 0.1.5

- Added `IntoVec` adapters that simplify in-memory de- and encoding. A further
  'one-shot' interface is exposed in the `Decoder` and `Encoder` themselves
  which makes the process a one liner in the simplest cases. Contrary to
  `IntoStream`, these are available in all cases and do not require `std`.

## Version 0.1.4

- Added `IntoAsync` adapters for asynchronous de- and encoding. The interface
  is implemented only in terms of `futures = 0.3` traits at the moment.
- Code sizes smaller than 2 are now allowed for decoding. Since they do not
  roundtrip it is still an error to use them in the decoder but this avoids
  accidental panicking, i.e. denial of service, in parsers.

## Version 0.1.3

- Fixes an issue in compression that caused some data to be lost around clear
  codes. This could corrupt the data stream.

## Version 0.1.2

- Fixes incorrect compression after `Encoder::reset`.

## Version 0.1.1 

- The `IntoStream` types now reuse their internal buffers.
- Added the methods `set_buffer`, `set_buffer_size` to `IntoStream` for both
  the encoder and decoder, used to control the automatic allocation.
- Deprecated `IntoStream` in configurations without the `std` feature where the
  type can't even be constructed.

## Version 0.1.0 â€“ Aleph

- Initial major release
- Support gif and tiff code size changes
- Rough performance numbers:
  On i5-4690, 8GiB DIMM DDR3 Synchronous 1600 MHz (0,6 ns)
  ~70MB/s encode, ~230MB/s decode
