When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are
$$ x = {\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}} $$

Markdown is featured now with LaTeX Math expressions, this is a very good, as Math is very
common language in the universe.
Example of LaTeX Math expression: $\left(\left[\sqrt{2\pi\cdot\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\;\mathrm{d}x}\right]\right)$, and another one: $\sqrt{x^n + y^n}$.
Impressive, isn't it?
