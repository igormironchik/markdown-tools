The field of Egyptology is only about 176 years old; that
is, only six generations have arisen since Jean-Francois
Champollion completed the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs in 1824.
Since then, Egyptologists have seen, generation by
generation, the likes of Mariette, Lepsius, Petrie, ScribnerScribnerScribnered,
„ern&, Habachi, and all of their respective contemporaries who
have contributed their researches and understanding to the study
of ancient Egypt. Now recent years have seen the torch of
enquiry pass to a new generation of scholars. However, even as
scholarship continues to improve, and new standards of research
evolve, Egyptologists are always aware that they stand
academically on the shoulders of their predecessors, accumulating
new knowledge and insights and building upon and refining earlier
interpretations, as well as rejecting them where appropriate.
With these ideas in mind, the purpose of this paper is to place
into historical context the work of Professor James Henry
Breasted in the study of ancient Egypt, and, moreover, to show
that his two major works, A History of Egypt and the Ancient
Records of Egypt actually mark a turning point in Egyptological
studies, inaugurating the era of modern Egyptology.

Although compared to Europe, America had come late to
Egyptology and Near Eastern studies, Breasted realized that
developing the scientific methodologies of this new approach
could be America's lasting contribution to these fields. In time
Breasted came to realize the need to establish a new institute
for the comprehensive study of the ancient Near East modeled
along the lines of scientific enquiry. Sometimes he even
referred to this institute as a "research laboratory."[^1]
Ultimately, he managed to convince some of the most rational of
people, i.e., America's corporate industrial and commercial
leaders, including John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (Standard Oil),
Martin Ryerson (Inland Steel), and Julius Rosenwald (Sears and
Roebuck). By 1919, with their help, he founded the Oriental
Institute of The University of Chicago.[^2] Here was an
international center for broad-ranging interdisciplinary research
in the civilizations and languages of the ancient Near East.

By 1905, Breasted completed editing his compendium of
Egyptian historical texts, and between 1906 and 1907, he
published it as the Ancient Records of Egypt: Historical
Documents from the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest.[^3]
However, as great and as useful as this collection was, it was
only the second of two related publications that appeared within
a year of each other. Previously in 1905, Breasted published A
History of Egypt,[^4] which was his new and comprehensive study of
Egyptian political and social history. In addition to being
remarkably well written, the strength of this work was that it
was exhaustively researched, and its argumentation was firmly
grounded on the full body of Egyptian historical texts, as they
were known then, and which Breasted had translated according to
the highest grammatical standards of the day.

To this day, no other general history of Egypt has had a useful
lifetime as extensive as Breasted's History of Egypt. Sixty-five
years after his death, Breasted's scholarship, although dated, is
still highly regarded, and as late as 1995, Who was Who in
Egyptology cited it as, "probably the best general history of
Pharaonic Egypt ever published."[^5] Even until today, A History of
Egypt is still useful in many ways.

A History of Egypt and the Ancient Records of Egypt mark a
milestone in the history of Egyptology. Breasted's methodology
was precise and well-considered. He intended the Ancient Records
and A History of Egypt to be a related pair.

Late in the writing of the Ancient Records, Breasted was
convinced that the scope of the project should be broadened to
include the texts of other cultures of the ancient Near East.

Breasted also planned to augment his five volumes of the Egyptian
historical records with seven new volumes of records of other
types (economic, religious, etc.).[^6] However, the project was not
to get off the ground anytime soon due to the untimely death of
Harper, compounded by the advent of World War I and then the
later reorganization of Breasted's department and staff to found
the Oriental Institute. It was not until 1926 that two volumes
of the Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylonia appeared, edited
by Daniel D. Luckenbill. Unfortunately, these were the last
volumes ever to be published in the Ancient Records series.

Breasted spent ten years copying, collecting and translating
texts for the Ancient Records of Egypt. Finally in 1904, he
closed the manuscript to further additions, and he began the
final editing of the publication. Thereafter, the great work was
published in five volumes, each volume appearing separately in
print from 1906 to 1907. Volumes one to four contained the
historical documents themselves arranged in chronological order
through the length of Egyptian history up to the Persian conquest
of the sixth century B.C. Volume five consisted of various
indices and word-lists that make the corpus accessible for
reference and research. The specific contents of the volumes
were divided as follows:

Volume 1: Dynasties 1 to 17 (c. 3050-1570 B.C.)

Volume 2: Dynasty 18 (c. 1570-1293 B.C.)

Volume 3: Dynasty 19 (c. 1293-1185 B.C.)

Volume 4: Dynasties 20-26 (c. 1185-525 B.C.)

Volume 5: Indices and corrections

The texts of each volume were arranged chronologically in order
of era or king's reign.

On the other hand, Breasted prepared his renderings in a simple
idiomatic English that was easy for any person to comprehend. As
he noted in his preface, he consciously avoided any paraphrasing
in his translations, a practice that he lamented was, otherwise,
too common in his day. Rather, he stated that his effort was to
render the Egyptian as literally as possible without wrenching
English idiom.[^7]

As for comprehensiveness and consistency, prior to the
publication of the Ancient Records, there was no comparable
collection of translations of Egyptian texts in any language. So
Breasted noted in his Preface to volume one, "no attempt has ever
been made to collect and present all the sources of Egyptian
history in a modern language"[^8] (italics added). While
previously, Near Eastern scholars did collaborate to pool their
translations into single publications,[^9] they never included the
entire corpus of any written genre, nor did the various scholars
regularize their translations to make them consistent with each
other. For these reasons, styles of translations differed from
text to text in the same compendia, and the same words might even
be translated differently. In his volumes, Breasted worked to
overcome such limitations by being as inclusive as possible in
his choice of documents, as well as consistent in all his
translations.

Near Eastern scholars and the reading public were quick to
recognize the Ancient Records of Egypt as a great achievement,
and in general, they received it with enthusiasm. All the
reviewers, American and otherwise, were consistent in praising
the publication for its readability and comprehensiveness, as
well as its epigraphic trustworthiness and philological
authority. No one doubted the accuracy of Breasted's
hieroglyphic copies nor the quality of his translations. What is
interesting, however, was the reaction of certain English and
French colleagues. The issues where they found fault sometimes
reflected as much upon their own sense of nationalism and rancor
against German Egyptology and the Berlin school, as much as on
purely Egyptological issues. So French Egyptologist George
Foucart, although praising the volumes overall, complained that
Breasted ignored the work of French Egyptologists, and he
neglected to include certain important French studies in his
bibliography, which - on the whole - he took as a slight against the
French school of Egyptology.[^10] However, a dispassionate perusal
of Breasted's footnotes and citations reveals Foucart's com-
plaints to be unjustified, since there are many references to
the works of French Egyptologists. Breasted later responded to
these charges himself in the Preface to volume five (p. viii),
where he noted that the work of certain French Egyptologists was
omitted necessarily because it became available only after
October 1904, when his manuscript was closed to further
additions.

Similarly, while British reviews generally praised the work,
some of these also could not refrain from casting their comments
within nationalistic frames of references. So, e.g., one
unidentified reviewer wrote:

> Some twenty-five years ago the Berlin School . . . gave
  birth to the theory that Egyptian was a Semitic
  language; . . . but unfortunately the professors of the
  Berlin School, instead of answering in detail the
  objections which their French, Italian, and English
  colleagues were not slow to bring against it, seem to
  have resolved to treat it henceforth as proved, and to
  ignore as far as may be the work of every Egyptologist
  who is not prepared at once to pronounce their
  shibboleth. This Bismarckian method of compelling the
  adoption of their own conclusions by hook or by crook
  has aroused much heartburning, and Dr. Breasted, who
  throughout his Egyptological career has shown himself
  more German than the Germans, has thought fit to adopt
  it. . . . Exactly one-half of the corrigenda which Dr.
  Breasted announces in his fifth volume are caused by
  the uncouth and barbarous system of transliteration
  which forms the trademark of Berlin Egyptology. . . .[^11]

Breasted was trained in Germany, and he always maintained close
relations with his colleagues and teachers there, except during
World War One (1917-1919). His adoption and popularization of
the Berlin transliteration system did cause some resentment among
those French and English Egyptologists who still had stubbornly
clung to their older less precise and increasingly obsolete
system. However, only a short time thereafter, the Berlin system
did become the standard international system of transliteration
in Egyptology, and it remains so today.

throughout Breasted's career, his colleagues did identify him
closely with German Egyptologists and German Egyptology in
general. Among most of them, this was never an issue. However,
later during the hysteria associated with World War One, a few
apparently went so far as to maliciously question his political
loyalties and to cast unjustified aspersions against him. This
issue was partially laid to rest when his son, Charles, joined
the U.S. Army in 1917 with the prospect of serving on the
European front (q.v., C. Breasted, Pioneer to the Past: The Story
of James H. Breasted, (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1943),
227, 234f).

Ninety-four years after its initial publication, we must
ask, how useful does the Ancient Records of Egypt remain today
for both modern academic purposes and for general reading and
referencing?
